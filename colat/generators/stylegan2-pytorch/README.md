# StyleGAN 2 in PyTorch

Implementation of Analyzing and Improving the Image Quality of StyleGAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958) in PyTorch

## Notice

I have tried to match official implementation as close as possible, but maybe there are some details I missed. So please use this implementation with care.

## Requirements

I have tested on:

* PyTorch 1.3.1
* CUDA 10.1/10.2

## Usage

First create lmdb datasets:

> python prepare_data.py --out LMDB_PATH --n_worker N_WORKER --size SIZE1,SIZE2,SIZE3,... DATASET_PATH

This will convert images to jpeg and pre-resizes it. This implementation does not use progressive growing, but you can create multiple resolution datasets using size arguments with comma separated lists, for the cases that you want to try another resolutions later.

Then you can train model in distributed settings

> python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=N_GPU --master_port=PORT train.py --batch BATCH_SIZE LMDB_PATH

train.py supports Weights & Biases logging. If you want to use it, add --wandb arguments to the script.

### Convert weight from official checkpoints

You need to clone official repositories, (https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) as it is requires for load official checkpoints.

For example, if you cloned repositories in ~/stylegan2 and downloaded stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pkl, You can convert it like this:

> python convert_weight.py --repo ~/stylegan2 stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pkl

This will create converted stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pt file.

If using GCC, you might have to set `-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1` in `~/stylegan2/dnnlib/tflib/custom_ops.py`.

### Generate samples

> python generate.py --sample N_FACES --pics N_PICS --ckpt PATH_CHECKPOINT  

You should change your size (--size 256 for example) if you train with another dimension.   

### Project images to latent spaces

> python projector.py --ckpt [CHECKPOINT] --size [GENERATOR_OUTPUT_SIZE] FILE1 FILE2 ...

## Pretrained Checkpoints

I have trained the 256px model on FFHQ 550k iterations. I got FID about 4.5. Maybe data preprocessing, resolution, training loop could made this difference, but currently I don't know the exact reason of FID differences.

## Samples

At 110,000 iterations. (trained on 3.52M images)

To match FID scores more closely to tensorflow official implementations, I have used FID Inception V3 implementations in https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid
