You need to download and save pretrained models from [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DIueVjIEmICS2oZ_kXcf_Ml0MVvyTn04?usp=sharing) to the associated folder under the [models](/models) with name ``model.pt``. For example, download model under ``stylegan2/ffhq`` and save it to the path ``models/stylegan2/ffhq/model.pt``.
