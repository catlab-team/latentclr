## Demo

You can use the [notebook](/demo/Demo.ipynb) provided for a quick demo.

* [configs](/demo/configs) contain direction meta data
* [models](/demo/models) contain model meta data

You need to download and save pretrained models from [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DIueVjIEmICS2oZ_kXcf_Ml0MVvyTn04?usp=sharing) to the associated folder under the [models](/demo/models) with name ``model.pt``. For example, download model under ``stylegan2/ffhq`` and save it to the path ``models/stylegan2/ffhq/model.pt``.
